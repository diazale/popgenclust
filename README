### Density-based clustering for genotype data

This page is a companion to our poster at ASHG2020:
Density-based clustering from large multi-ethnic biobanks improves risk prediction in large, diverse cohorts. https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9070/presentation/2384.

For an interactive demonstration using 1000 Genomes Project data, see: https://diazale.github.io/popgenclust/1000gp.html

We are currently working on our manuscript for this project -- come back soon for a preprint! For our previous work on dimension reduction of genotype data, see:
